# About

This is just what I've been experimenting with since learning C.


### Experiments:
1. Check the size of an array
2. Using structure and doing "pointer function"
3. Dynamically allocate memory for arrays and makes an algorithm that inserts string to another string.
4. Bubble sorting an array
5. Using pointer to change a variable value
6. Random integer and guessing number game
7. View ASCII chars
8. Trying out random string generator
9. List files from directory and check the file stat
10. Trying making a better `listdir` (idk if it's good)
11. Deleting an element in the middle of the array (dynamic array)
12. Better quicksort (this thing fails on a `struct` pointer and idk why)
